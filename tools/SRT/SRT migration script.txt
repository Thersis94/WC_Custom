1.	Update DB connections in pgLoader Scripts, WC_Custom/scripts/srt/user_import_config.properties to be pointed to proper Locations
2.	Ensure db connection is pointed at proper location and run pgloader scripts with aabnp.load and customs.load found in WC_Custom/tools/SRT (>1 min)
		./pgloader aabnp.load
		./pgloader customs.load

3.	Run V20180131.140600--feature-srt-2-migration-script.sql (~1min)
4.	Run Site Copy of SRT to target Instance.  Raptor Depuy DB is current master for exports and the insert record to access that location in admintool is below. (~1min)
	jdbc:postgresql://playstation:5432/raptor_webcrescendo_depuyb?defaultRowFetchSize=25&amp;prepareThreshold=3|org.postgresql.Driver|raptor|sqll0gin

5.	Verify Copy successful and update WC_Custom/scripts/srt/user_import_config.properties SiteId if different than new and ensure db connection is pointed at proper location.  Production is looking like it will expect DPY_SYN_38 unless things change.
