Christopher Winn	Hardcover, 304 pages; 2012	21.24	Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas conducted their affair in rooms 346 and 362 at the Savoy; Claude Monet painted Waterloo Bridge from a hotel balcony; and Fred Astaire danced on the roof with his sister Adele in 1923. The Savoy Hotel's oldest resident is a black cat called Kaspar, who makes himself available as a dinner guest whenever a party of 13 sits down to a meal, bringing the number up to 14. He wears a napkin and is served each dish at the same time as the other diners. Kaspar is, apparently, a good listener, although his manner is a bit wooden--he was carved out of wood by the designer Basil Ionides in 1925.

10	UE9312	The Disappeared		14	0	Be warned: This novel is a heartbreaker. It's the story of Anne Greves, a young Canadian student who falls in love with Serey, a Cambodian musician forced into exile by the Khmer Rouge regime. Despite her father's disapproval, Anne's relationship with Serey intensifies, but eventually Serey returns home to look for his family. Anne waits. Years go by. One day Anne thinks she spots Serey on TV at a political rally in Phnom Penh. She leaves safe, snowy Montreal to search for him in the killing fields and broken villages of a jungle country racked by war. Sometimes Anne writes directly to Serey, sometimes she tells us about him, but always it is in exquisite prose. Serey believed that the Khmer Rouge used words to kill people, that slogans were weapons. Anne turns words into music, a love song, a haunting elegy. Yes, I was moved to tears, but I wouldn't have missed this book for the world. <br><br><b> A Reader Review by Joan Ripley of Charlottesville, Virginia </b>		Kim Echlin	Paperback, 235 pages; 2009	11.9					0	YES	UB3992	1							0			1AB;1AC	FICTION > STRICTLY FICTION									THE DISAPPEARED;UE9312	UE9312	UE9312	UE9312			0				1										NSPG12	5	0000-00-00	1						0	2012-03-15				0000-00-00 00:00:00

Amidst such grave circumstances, an upbeat book about good manners could have been considered frivolous. But, instead, it was well received--possibly because (as the author believes) <i>"the one part of life we could control was our behavior at home. We could create sanctuaries of courtesy and kindness."</i><b> 365 Manners Kids Should Know </b>offers warm, wise, and extremely thorough etiquette advice--on everything from basic grooming to being a good friend to social media navigation--for parents to discuss with kids. It's all broken down into palatable little daily tidbits and all presented with comforting humor and common sense.

Such an endorsement would make any perfume famous--if it wasn't already the bestselling scent in the world. Created in the glittering days of the Jazz Age by Coco Chanel and a perfumer with ties to the ill-fated Romanovs, Chanel No. 5 was an instant sensation. During World War II, soldiers lined up outside the couturier's Paris boutique to buy the fragrance for their sweethearts back home, and bottles of it could be used as currency on the black market. Yet by 1945, Coco Chanel was prepared to ruin her magnificent creation to avenge a business deal gone wrong. Thankfully, she failed: Ninety years after the perfume's debut, the French government estimates that a bottle of Chanel No. 5 is sold every thirty seconds. A heady blend of science and history, with a whiff of scandal for good measure, this "biography" explores the fascinating life of one of the modern world's most coveted		Tilar J.

Garfield in the back on July 2, 1881. The first doctors on the scene, frantic to remove the bullet from Garfield's body, inserted their unsterilized fingers into the president's wound. His medical care during the remaining eighty days of his life did not improve as American doctors had yet to widely accept the existence of germs or understand infection. In desperation, his doctors even summoned Alexander Graham Bell to test a prototype metal detector in order to find the rogue bullet. Bringing to vivid life the astonishing tale of the agonizing demise of a great man who could have been a great president, Candice Millard has written a gripping story of ego, delusion, and ambition--and a series of events that altered the course of the United States.

Appointed as president of the Board of Police Commissioners by the (Republican) governor of New York, Roosevelt wanted not only to clamp down on vice but also to break the hold that Tammany Hall had on the police department. Roosevelt attacked the job with his famous verve, conducting midnight walks, known as Roosevelt's Rambles, through the city to catch police shirking their duties.

74	UE9772	The Sense of an Ending		19.16	23.95	A concise and penetrating novel about identity and memory, Julian Barnes's latest work is the well-deserved recipient of the 2011 Man Booker Prize for fiction. When Tony Webster learns he's to receive a bewildering bequest upon the death of a woman he barely remembers, the middle-aged divorc&eacute; revisits the formative memories of his youth--specifically his friendship with an intelligent and enigmatic classmate named Adrian and his first forays into love with a coed named Veronica. The reemergence of Veronica into his life, however, forces Tony to question the accuracy of his own recollection of the past. A beautifully written and revelatory meditation on time that also functions as a surprisingly suspenseful psychological mystery, <b>The Sense of an Ending</b> begs to be reread as soon as you reach the shocking conclusion.		Julian Barnes	Hardcover, 163 pages; 2011	0	It strikes me that this may be one of the differences between youth and age: when we are young, we invent different futures for ourselves; when we are old, we invent different pasts for others.

To remedy this conundrum-- and to add a classic touch to a birthday celebration--we offer the hilariously tongue-in-cheek <b>Roman Candles</b>! The eight wax letters included (one L, three Xs, one V, and three Is) can be arranged to represent any age up to 89--but you can also fake most of the 90s (an IX and an IV for 94, for example). Don't worry: A quick refresher course in Roman numerals is included, just in case.

77	UE5782	The Bible: A Biography		14	0	Karen Armstrong is a well-respected religious historian (and former nun) whose work is required reading in many theology courses. Thus it comes as no surprise that she was the one to pen this thought-provoking and often surprising "biography" of the world's bestselling book. The Bible's story begins in 597 BCE, when political turmoil between Judah and Babylonia led to the destruction of Solomon's temple. From that point in history, Armstrong goes on to explore the blending of various oral traditions to form the root of the Hebrew Bible; the edits made when Old Testament writings were translated from Hebrew to Greek; the origins of the Jesus movement and the gradual division of Judaism and Christianity; conflicting interpretations by the Catholic Church and Martin Luther; and the attacks on biblical text during the Age of Enlightenment. Fair warning: Some readers will balk at Armstrong's conclusions, while others will find the historical information deepens their spiritual studies.

She opens it to find a trio of unexpected guests: a deaf man, a developmentally disabled woman, and a newborn baby girl. She offers them shelter, but within hours, staffers from the nearby School for the Incurable and Feebleminded have tracked down the couple. The workers don't know about the baby, and as they bundle the new mother, Lynnie, into a straitjacket, she looks at Martha and whispers two desperate words: "Hide her." In that instant, a secret is born, one to which Martha, Lynnie, and the deaf man, Homan, will devote their lives. By turns heartbreaking and heartwarming, <b>The Story of Beautiful Girl</b> follows these remarkable people along their disparate paths for more than forty years, until a series of fateful events finally draws them together again.

So, set aside your better judgment, and prepare to laugh at these once discarded cartoons from illustrious <i>New Yorker</i> contributors.

Filled with sinister plots, ruthless power moves, and romantic liaisons with deadly consequences, Ford's vivid fictional rendering of the inner workings of the Tudor court and the political upheaval during the English Reformation is rich with suspense and intrigue.

Some of his entries might seem comically egregious (do people really use <i>abominable</i> instead of <i>abdominal</i>?), many are familiar conundrums (when to use i.e. versus e.g.), and others may come as a surprise to even the most grammar-conscious among us (it should be <i>strait-laced,</i> not <i>straight-laced</i>).

Pet owners of any type and temperament are sure to find <b>Oink</b> exceedingly amusing.		Matt Whyman	Hardcover, 314 pages; 2011	20.4	Then the first string of spittle fell upon the mini-pig's back, followed by another, and that's when my huge hellhound gave in to temptation. A cry died in my throat as Sesi's head dropped down, but she didn't snap up Roxi in her jaws. Instead, very gently, she licked her. Not just once but slathering her all over. For a moment, I wondered whether maybe a dog's saliva had the capacity to tenderize its prey. I just could not fathom any other reason why she would be doing it&hellip;.I had always considered my dog to possess a murderous instinct, not a maternal one, but here it was in full effect.

125	UE9572	Just My Type: A Book About Fonts		23.38	27.5	Why was there such an angry reaction to Comic Sans, including a widespread campaign to have it banned? Was the impassioned outcry justified? Is the Frutiger typeface truly <i>"the finest ever made for signs and directions"?</i>Why is Helvetica ubiquitous? What makes a font seem feminine or masculine? What's the worst font of all time? Did the<i> "contemporary sophistication"</i> of the Gotham typeface used by Obama in the 2008 campaign help take him to the White House? Who creates fonts and how do they go about it? Totally (if perhaps unexpectedly) captivating, this "Book About Fonts" explores all these topics and more, celebrating<i> "our relationship with letters" </i>and elucidating how meaning can be transformed by the way words look.

Proposing, among other ingenious and revolutionary ideas, that there existed laws of nature that could not be affected by gods, this richly metaphorical poem of ancient physics was quite scandalous for its time, and could easily have been destroyed by religious or political leaders. And, indeed, the manuscript was all but lost to the world until the 1400s, when a passionate Italian book hunter named Poggio Bracciolini found it. <b>The Swerve</b> tells the deeply compelling story of Bracciolini's miraculous discovery and how it fueled the Renaissance and influenced great artists and thinkers for centuries to come.

Miller--a slave--looked exactly like Salom&eacute; Muller, who had emigrated with her family from Germany as a child and then disappeared. More than twenty years had passed, but what had happened? Was this really Salome, or an uncanny coincidence? The question of the girl's identity and right to be free was brought to trial, ensnaring the best legal minds in Louisiana, the cream of New Orleans society, and the sizable German immigrant population. Over the course of several months, the drama and tension generated by the case captivated the entire South. This is a first-rate legal thriller, only more amazing for being true.

And while I can still be thrilled and delighted by a book, it has become very tough to surprise me. And then I read <b>A Dark Dividing</b>. The plot spans a near-100-year period, from the simpering affectations of the Bloomsbury Group to the tabloid newspapers of the early twenty-first century. But looming over it all is the dreadful Mortmain House, a hideous orphanage on the Welsh border with a sinister history. <b>A Dark Dividing</b> is much more than just a scare-fest, even though a chilly finger will most definitely go skittering down your spine.

After a whirlwind courtship, they marry; two weeks later, Charles-Edouard heads off to war--but not before leaving Grace pregnant with a little "blessing." When the war ends, Charles-Edouard returns to England just long enough to whisk Grace and their son, Sigismond, off to his ancestral home in France. For Grace, life among the wealthy in glittering, postwar Paris seems like a dream--until she learns that the French have a very laissez-faire attitude about marital fidelity. She flees Paris with Sigi in tow, hoping her departure will bring her wayward husband to heel. Unfortunately for Grace, Sigi has other plans. As shrewd as his father is charming, the Valhuberts' blessing quickly deduces that only a complete divorce of nuptial affection will ensure that he is spoiled properly by everyone involved.

148	UE8102	A Man Lay Dead		14.95	0	The "Golden Age" of English crime fiction--roughly the 1920s through the 1940s--is widely understood to have had three queens: Margery Allingham, Agatha Christie, and Dorothy L. Sayers, with Josephine Tey as perhaps a grand duchess, and the sly, irrepressible Edmund Crispin a court jester. But only Ngaio Marsh was known as the Empress. Born in New Zealand, she wrote thirty-two novels featuring the very British inspector Roderick Alleyn. <b>A Man Lay Dead</b>, Alleyn's first outing, also features that hallmark of the Golden Age, the country-house party--a setting guaranteed to provide lots of suspects, lots of hiding places, and (from a contemporary reader's perspective) lots of really great clothes. Sadly, it's not providing much of interest for the guests, until Sir Hubert Handsley announces that he has devised a new and especially exciting version of that creaky old parlor entertainment, The Murder Game.

And so Dolly finds solace in her neighbors' gossip about the Mickelson clan, Pine Rapids's founding family, whose grand house on the hill Dolly has coveted since she arrived.

His stepmother and his younger half-brother, Martin, are more than a little peeved that Gervase survived the war intact and has returned to take control of his inheritance. To add insult to injury, the earl takes an interest in the pretty heiress down the lane--the very girl Martin has set his sights on. Gervase assumes the family conflict will abate once everyone settles in to the new order of things. But when a series of "accidents" befall the young earl, it becomes clear that someone is out to remove Gervase permanently.

Of the twenty-four U.S. servicemen and -women aboard, only three--two men and a Women's Army Corps member--survived the fiery crash. The survivors were seriously injured and short on food, water, and medical supplies. To make matters worse, the uncharted valley in which they were stranded was surrounded by warring tribes of natives who, to the best of the Americans' knowledge, had never before laid eyes on a white man--let alone a white woman. Journalist Mitchell Zuckhoff draws from interviews, military documents, and a survivor's diary to tell this thrilling true story of survival, courage, and unexpected friendship in the face of staggering odds.

Business has been slow (as in, nonexistent), until a mysterious woman comes knocking on the door. The widow of a famous architect, she'd like Sandro to determine why her husband drowned himself. And since when it rains, it pours (and in this Florentine November, it is raining all the time), Sandro finds himself saddled with a second case: A flamboyant young English heiress has disappeared from one of the city's many international schools of art. It may be clich&eacute;d to claim that a book's setting acts as a character in the narrative, but it's actually true in <b>The Drowning River</b>, with the River Arno winding through the plotline and making a single, coherent whole of elements that, like Sandro's cases, seem at first to have little to do with each other.

199	UE9372	Emily, Alone		15	0	Emily Maxwell, the eighty-something widow who is the focus of this unusual novel, finds her day-to-day routine suddenly altered when her sister-in-law (and unofficial chauffeur) suffers a stroke. Emboldened by her new independence, Emily tentatively begins to develop an inner strength she thought she'd never find again. Masterful author Stewart O'Nan presents roughly a year in Emily's life via precise and incisive vignettes of her daily pleasures and crises: completing her daily crossword, fussing over her elderly dog, attending flower shows and art openings, navigating tricky conversations with her children, yearning for visits from her grandchildren (while lamenting their lack of social graces), attending funerals of friends, mourning the changing landscape of her neighborhood.

When a letter finally does arrive, it delivers the worst possible news: Her estranged brother, the great composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, is dead. Devastated, Nannerl rushes to Vienna to pay her respects. Yet her grief takes on a new urgency when she learns that, in his final days, Wolfgang suspected he had been poisoned. Was it murder? Or were his suspicions the delusions of a fevered genius? Nannerl sets out to uncover the truth, drawing on her own skills as an accomplished musician to penetrate her brother's inner circle. There she learns of a conspiracy within the exclusive Masonic brotherhood, a dark secret that may conceal the answer to Wolfgang's death. Set against the snowy backdrop of an imperial Austrian winter, this splendid novel of music and mystery makes for excellent cold-weather reading.

There, the natives made a shocking observation: One of the ship's crew was actually a woman. The captain and other members of the expedition expressed surprise--but had they known all along? Glynis Ridley draws on ships' logs, diaries, and a variety of other sources to piece together the intriguing story of Jeanne Baret, a French peasant whose knowledge of herbs and folk remedies caught the attention of botanist Philibert Commerson. Jeanne became his research assistant as well as his lover, and when Commerson earned a coveted spot as botanist on the naval expedition, she disguised herself as "Jean" to accompany him. The subsequent voyage and deception were harrowing at times, but they also enabled Jeanne to explore parts of the globe where, at the time, few European men--let alone a woman--had ever set foot.

233	UE8362	Started Early, Took My Dog		14.99	0	Master of melding literary and detective fiction, Kate Atkinson has again created a witty and stylish novel that's as thought provoking as it is suspenseful. Jackson Brodie, Atkinson's charming, curmudgeonly gumshoe, is officially on the hunt for the English roots of an adopted client living abroad (and unofficially searching for his own con-artist wife). His quest leads him to cross paths with retired detective Tracy Waterhouse, whose recent foray into kidnapping (with only the noblest intentions) has her running from her former colleagues in the law and suspicious of everyone. But it's a homicide case from Tracy's past that interests Jackson. Long-suppressed facts about the gruesome 1970s murder gradually emerge, connecting the lives of a disparate cast of characters, and leaving all forever altered. <b>Started Early, Took My Dog</b> (the title is from an Emily Dickinson poem) is intelligent crime fiction at its best--with a lovable canine character, to boot.

But her artist's eye needs Florence and its impossibly seductive beauty the way a fish needs water, and so she's back, turning her face resolutely toward the future and away from that horrific past. But young women keep getting murdered, attacked in the same way that Mary was. The police told Mary that her tormentor committed suicide in prison. Did they lie? Was there another killer? Or is the pattern that Mary sees itself a lie, a fantasy woven of her own unacknowledged dread?<b> The Faces of Angels</b>is dark and rich and complex in flavor. It's commonplace to liken tales of psychological suspense to the work of Ruth Rendell, but, in truth, this owes more to Daphne du Maurier. It's gorgeous.

Intrigued by this phenomenon, Hopgood decided to investigate parenting practices from around the world, particularly those that challenge conventional American child-rearing wisdom. From the French secrets to instilling healthy--and sophisticated--eating habits, to a (sometimes messy) Chinese method of potty training that begins as young as six months old, to the completely stroller-free parenting lifestyle in Kenya, different cultural norms are explored via interviews with parents, anthropologists, and child-care experts. And Hopgood tries many of the techniques she comes across with her own daughter, with varying degrees of success.

258	UE7632	Agatha Christie and the Eleven Missing Days		19.95	0	December 1926: a local man from a southern English town finds a car on a landing below a cliff with a woman's coat inside. Police determine that the vehicle belongs to a young, beautiful author whose husband has just run off with another woman, but nobody has an explanation for what happened. Though it sounds like the plot of a Hercule Poirot mystery, the missing woman was Agatha Christie herself! What followed was the largest manhunt in British history for a missing person and a saga that made Christie a household name. The author was found in a resort town eleven days later. She claimed amnesia but most believed her actions to be a publicity stunt. In this riveting biography of the Queen of Mystery, Jared Cade explores the circumstances of the disappearance as the crux of Christie's life, and reveals how fallout from the strange sequence of events would affect both the author and her work for her remaining fifty years.

269	UE9662	A Nervous Splendor: Vienna 1888/1889		16	0	By the latter years of the nineteenth century, the royal family in Vienna had resisted the democratic movements that whittled away monarchal power throughout Europe. But Crown Prince Rudolf saw a backward-facing nation being left behind by modernism. In 1889, unable to bear the weight of empire, the charming prince shot and killed his teenage mistress and then himself. Despite the palpable tensions and laggard government in Vienna at this time, the city was also a fertile artistic and intellectual garden full of citizens on the forefront of their fields. A young Sigmund Freud was making remarkable discoveries in psychology; Gustav Klimt led the Vienna Secession painters to international renown; Gustav Mahler struggled to reckon with and succeed his artistic ancestor, Ludwig van Beethoven. Meanwhile, to an obscure innkeeper outside of Vienna, Adolf Hitler was born.<b>A Nervous Splendor</b> is a beautifully written account of a city in flux, pulling itself in opposite directions, full of energy and fascinating		Frederic Morton	Paperback, 340 pages; 1979	13.6		(CHH)			0	YES	UB3992	1							0			1BB;1BE	SERIOUS NON-FICTION > HISTORY									A NERVOUS SPLENDOR VIENNA 1888 1889;UE9662	UE9662	UE9662	UE9662			0				1										NSPG12	58	0000-00-00	1						0	2012-03-15				0000-00-00 00:00:00

But, in warfare, the best-laid plans often fall apart. Managing to kidnap the general proved dangerous enough, but then the band had to elude the vengeful German army until they could get off the island. Cut off from contact with their headquarters, the duo had to both salvage the mission and get out with their lives, with only their wits and friendly Cretans to assist them.<b> Ill Met By Moonlight </b>is W.

But illness and the Civil War propelled the young man west into the virtually lawless American frontier, where his genteel manners and medical know-how stood in stark contrast to his reputation as a bourbon-swilling gambler. In these pages we meet the prostitute he loved and the mother he adored, as well as the friends and enemies he made in a notorious Kansas cattle town called Dodge. The Earp brothers and Bat Masterson play pivotal roles in Holliday's story, yet Doc is no shoot-'em-up Western.

Roy Aronson has done both of those pulse-quickening things, and many equally amazing others. Dr. Aronson and his wife Kate have been private practicing veterinarians in South Africa since 1984. Many of Dr. Aronson's best stories about his adventures treating African wildlife are collected in this exciting, nerve-wracking, and often heart-wrenching collection.

After all, a mountainside timber camp is no place for a woman of breeding. But Serena Pemberton quickly proves herself to be as tough and as shrewd as any man, earning the grudging respect of the loggers and the steadily deepening devotion of her husband. Partners in business as well as love, Serena and Pemberton revel in their shared ambition, ruthlessly toppling their rivals en route to building a timber empire. The only dark spot is Rachel, the local woman with whom Pemberton conceived a child before his marriage. He expresses no interest in Rachel or the boy, so Serena is unconcerned--until she learns that she will never be able to have a baby of her own. Suddenly Rachel and her son are a threat, one Serena sets out to neutralize with systematic, coldblooded vengeance.

Though fraternizing between inmates and patients was forbidden, White's work detail put him in daily contact with often badly disfigured victims of Hansen's disease (once known as leprosy), who had been taken from their families years earlier and forcibly quarantined in this clandestine community. Neil White's memoir of his year among criminals and outcasts charts his journey from arrogance to humility, with the help of a colorful cast of characters including convicted killers and thieves, saintly clergy members, and the patients of the colony, whose kindness and optimism despite their brutal treatment by society inspired White to become a better person.

But I've discovered recently that when I relax into it--cycle and recycle--repeat, respond, repeat--I understand there is comfort in the repetition. I've learned, for example, that if my mother initiates the repeat conversation, she is truly interested in the subject or has something she wants me to know. Today I am learning that laughter is always worth repeating. As we eat our dinner and I get Mom resettled into her room, I become my mother: telling and retelling the same story [about a witty comment she had made that day], relishing the joy she experiences when she realizes how clever she still is.

Cotter guides the reader on a leisurely stroll through both the wild and the cultivated Irish countryside, musing upon the aristocratic roots of the asparagus, the etymology of sea spinach, the contradictions of the elderflower, the "holy trinity" of roots (carrots, parsnips, and turnips), and more. Peppered with Cotter's amusing and informative anecdotes are sumptuous color photographs and, of course, plenty of mouthwatering recipes for such dishes as wild garlic and walnut pesto, tomatillo salsa, and gooseberry and elderflower rippled parfait.

With a succinctness reminiscent of Strunk and White, Bernard DeVoto comments on the pure way to drink alcohol.

On any day of the week, the hour starts at 6 p.m., when the world turns violet. It should always be enjoyed respectfully and, in that regard, DeVoto makes it clear that<i> "a cocktail does not contain fruit juice."</i> Even if you don't touch alcohol, you'll enjoy this collection of four essays from the 1940s and '50s.

353	UE2452	Haikubes		24.95	0	The Bas Bleu staff had a grand time coming up with the above haiku. We just rolled the two red dice to figure out a theme: "a reflection on" and "our world." Then we sifted through the evocative nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs found on the sixty-three word dice (there are different words on all six sides of each, or a blank space for you to come up with your own). The cube format makes it easy to manipulate expressive words into the 5/7/5-syllable format of the ancient Japanese verse form.

374	UE6992	The Private World of Georgette Heyer		14.99	0	For more than fifty years, Georgette Heyer's sparkling Regency novels and deftly plotted whodunits topped British bestseller lists. Yet for all her success, Heyer was a fiercely private person. She consistently refused to grant interviews or attend her own publicity events, and she only ever answered one fan letter. (When you read it, you'll understand why she did.) Originally published a decade after Heyer's death, this illuminating biography offers a rare glimpse into the literary phenomenon's personal life, drawing on her abundant correspondence with her publishers and agents. It reveals a complex woman who, though happily married, was far from the dreamy romantic her fans imagined her to be. In reality she was a meticulous researcher who worked at a killing pace and was her own worst critic. Charming yet shy in society, she could be formidable and demanding when the integrity of her work was threatened. This is fascinating stuff! (Look for Heyer's novels scattered throughout the Bas Bleu catalog.)

Bea becomes an accomplice to both Julian and his sister, Iris, in their attempt to escape their overbearing father in the City of Light. In the course of a few months, Bea's collusion with her niece and nephew takes her from Paris to Hollywood, where she spies on her brother, meddles with her possibly insane sister-in-law, and confronts her ex-husband--inevitably (and inadvertently) wreaking havoc in her wake. At once comically entertaining and chillingly tragic, <b>Foreign Bodies</b> is an intelligent literary novel that proves itself worthy of its Jamesian inspiration.

380	UE7602	1858: Abraham Lincoln, Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, Ulysses S. Grant and the War They Failed to See		15.99	0	In 1858, Abraham Lincoln debated Stephen Douglas, the most popular politician in the country, for a Senate seat. Robert E. Lee contemplated retiring from the Army to spend time with his family. And, as civilians, both Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman stared failure in the face. Meanwhile, President James Buchanan, believing the slavery issue had been put to rest by the Dred Scott decision and the Kansas-Nebraska Act, didn't understand the passions that were erupting on both sides of the controversy. The forces that would catapult the United States into civil war arranged themselves. Bruce Chadwick presents a lively and convincing argument that 1858 proved to be a critical year for the country. In the process, he paints vivid and compelling pictures of the men who were on the verge of moving the United States into its most perilous era.

381	UE5422	You've Been Sentenced!		24.95	0	Simple, silly, and lots of fun for the whole family, this unique game requires both creativity and good grammar. Each player starts with ten cards--which each have five words or phrases (worth five, ten, or twenty points, depending on how unwieldy they are) to choose from--and must build a sensible sentence using as many of the cards as possible. When the timer runs out, each player reads his sentence. If anyone objects that the sentence is grammatically unsound or insufficiently logical, the composer of the sentence gets the opportunity to defend his work. Majority rule determines whether or not the defender earns points for the sentence. Your word options are always somewhat limited-so, if you go for big points, you may find yourself trying to explain how something like "Blondish women with ducks laughed at the stranger on the monkey bars" is a perfectly rational thing to say.

But delivering babies isn't enough for Mary, whose determination to become a surgeon has earned her the scorn of practically every physician and medical school in New York. Her ambition is heightened when her sweet-tempered twin sister captures the heart of their handsome next-door neighbor, a young man whom Mary secretly loves. So when war breaks out in 1861 and President Lincoln puts out a call for army nurses, Mary packs her bags and heads south to Washington. She finds work with a jaded surgeon in a primitive hospital in Georgetown, where treating the casualties of war will push Mary to the limits of her physical and emotional endurance.

But how could anyone have entered the locked room to commit the crime? Inspector Hemingway of Scotland Yard must sift through the scant evidence--and the outspoken opinions and conflicting testimonies of the colorful assortment of holiday revelers--to discover the truth.

Carolyn See pens a moving tribute to a wild half-coyote dog who became a member of her family; Jane Smiley describes the unexpected loss of her beloved horse, Mr. T.; Michael Chitwood reminisces during the final hours of his sixteen-year-old cat, The General--these pieces and more (by Anne Lamott, Jacqueline Winspear, and Mark Doty, among others) provide the kind of commiseration and comfort that can only be found in literature. A kind and thoughtful gift for one who has lost a beloved companion, <b>Cherished</b> is as much about celebrating the human-animal bond as mourning the loss of a pet.

So Poirot travels to the English country town of Market Basing to restore Bob's good name, and he soon finds that many eccentric characters--including a suddenly wealthy companion of the deceased, a playboy nephew, and a sultry would-be heiress--have motives for murder.

440	UA9042	Two Old Women		12.99	0	Sa' was seventy-five years old and Ch'idzigyaak had seen eighty summers when the two old women were deserted by their nomadic tribe in the dead of a grim Arctic winter, because food had become too scarce to support life in the small band. Shocked, hurt, and angered by this betrayal, provided with only the knowledge gained by their years of experience and the small hatchet left for them by Ch'idzigyaak's grandson, the two determine that if they must die, they will "die trying." This is an Athabaskan legend framed powerfully in the written word by Athabaskan native Velma Wallis.

Having grown up in an oppressively religious household on the English coast between the two world wars, eight-year-old Margaret Marsh finds her eyes opened to a whole new world when her parents hire a buxom and vivacious nanny, Lydia, to entertain her. And the change in the air seems to infect her parents, as well: Mr. Marsh begins to take an uncomfortable interest in Lydia's "soul," and Mrs. Marsh reconnects with friends from her past, exposing Margaret to a side of her mother she has never known. But soon pent-up passions and repressed emotions rise to the surface, hurtling the whole family toward a dramatic precipice where young Margaret's life lies in the balance.

494	UC3052	Hercule Poirot's Christmas		10.46	13.95	Well into her career as the most popular mystery writer of all time, Agatha Christie received a complaint from her brother-in-law that her stories had become anemic. He longed for "a good violent murder with lots of blood." In this holiday story written especially for her demanding relation, Christie's brilliant detective Poirot is obliged to spend his Christmas investigating a ghastly murder in a mansion full of shady suspects. Bitter sibling rivalries and a fortune in diamonds form just part of the impenetrable maze. This classic mystery is recommended for anyone who won't mind dining on a series of red herrings this holiday season.

Thus you'll find JFK's favorite waffle recipe alongside a circa 1917 recipe for "potato sausages" from the records of the U.S. Food Administration; a baked rabbit dish from the <i>Manual for Army Cooks</i> (1879) in the same section as LBJ's ranch deer meat sausage recipe and instructions for creating Nancy Reagan's veal stew with red wine; a sugarless devil's food cake (1918) pages away from the recipe for Patricia Nixon and Edward Finch Cox's wedding cake!

496	UE5702	The Alienist		16	0	It's turn-of-the-twentieth-century New York City, and a young male prostitute's grotesquely mutilated body is found on the construction site of the new Williamsburg Bridge. Journalist John Moore is summoned by his old friend Dr. Lazlo Kriezler--a pioneer in the budding and controversial field of psychology--to help the "alienist" build a psychological portrait of the killer, whose list of victims is growing by the week. Working outside of (and often against) the corrupt NYPD, the men's secret criminal task force is aided by the new police commissioner, Theodore Roosevelt. As a complex portrait of a depraved killer begins to emerge, the civilian detectives must contend with dangerous gangsters, crooked cops, slimy politicians, angry immigrant mobs, and more--all the while in a race to prevent another brutal murder. If, like me, you missed this intelligent and pulse-quickening historical thriller when it was first published in 1994, you'll want to give Caleb Carr's modern classic of the genre a try--as long as		Caleb Carr	Paperback, 498 pages; 2006 (1994)	13.6		(AG)			0	YES	UB3992	1							0			1AB;1AD;2AB	FICTION > MYSTERY									THE ALIENIST	UE5702	UE5702	UE5702			0				1										NHOL11	24	0000-00-00	1						0	2011-10-13				0000-00-00 00:00:00

501	UE4992	The Paris Wife		25	0	Ernest Hemingway was just twenty years old when he met and fell in love with Hadley Richardson, a bright, kind-hearted woman from St. Louis who was eight years his senior. Their subsequent marriage (Hemingway's first of four) forms the heart of this insightful novel, narrated by Hadley and set primarily in the shabby-chic artists' arrondissements of post-World War I Paris. There, the Hemingways hobnob with Gertrude Stein, Alice Toklas, Ezra Pound, and F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. Ernest is in his literary element, gathering the material that will eventually become his breakout novel, <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>. But for Hadley, the life of a writer's wife is anything but glamorous. Deeply in love, she must grapple with the harsh realities of poverty, alcohol abuse, and Ernest's perpetually wandering eye. Frank and absorbing, <b>The Paris Wife</b> offers an intimate acquaintance with one of America's greatest writers, lifting the curtain of history to reveal the tragic casualties of literary genius.

The events are documented matter-offactly, but the intense drama and remarkable displays of courage and compassion are undeniable. Origo's riveting account of sheltering fugitives (both soldiers and civilians), improvising and hiding supplies, and weathering the destruction and sorrow of warfare testifies to the remarkably triumphant nature of the human heart.

517	UE4722	Major Pettigrew's Last Stand		15	0	Major Ernest Pettigrew, a retired widower in the small, English countryside village of Edgecombe St. Mary, is the witty, proper, oh-so- British, and exceedingly endearing protagonist of this utterly charming novel. The unexpected death of the major's brother leads to an equally unexpected friendship with Mrs. Ali, a Pakistani shopkeeper in town. As the two commiserate about deceased spouses and humorously self-involved friends and relatives--and share passions for gardening and literature--a sweet and gentle romance begins to blossom. But the village aristocracy, of which the major is a reluctant member, is unwilling to accept Mrs. Ali into their circle. The major, for whom tradition has always been king, finds himself increasingly at odds with the old guard. Astute, heart-warming, and often laugh-out-loud hilarious, <b>Major Pettigrew's Last Stand</b> is an elegant and intelligent comedy of manners that you'll want to share with everyone you know.

Opinionated, feisty, empathetic, and wry, Maf gives the reader an intimate view of the last two years of Marilyn's life--filled with parties and psychoanalysis, Hollywood elite and New York intellectuals, friendship and loneliness. This unique work of fiction is both quirkily amusing and tenderly perceptive.		Andrew O'Hagan	Paperback, 277 pages; 2011 (2010)	11.86	Marilyn took me everywhere. We had a lot of fun going up and down the avenues, Marilyn sometimes in a headscarf and sunglasses, completely unknown, running into the wind with our mouths open, and hungry for experience. I think we shared a feeling for the tribulations of the period, an instinct for killing the distance between the high and the low, something that would come in time to explain the depth of our friendship. If she brought out the actor in me then it might be said that I brought out the philosopher in her. The Marilyn I knew was smelly and fun and an artist to the very end of her fingertips.

522	UE4892	Once Upon a River		25.95	0	Margo Crane, the protagonist of this novel, grew up on the banks of Michigan's Stark River, a girl of few words and uncanny beauty. Raised by her father and grandfather to be fiercely independent, Margo can shoot a gun, skin a deer, and handle a boat as well as any man--if not better. Those survival skills are put to the test when a long-simmering family feud erupts in violence and sixteen-year-old Margo is forced to leave home. With no other options, she grabs her rifle, casts off her boat, and heads upstream in search of the mother who abandoned her years earlier. But the river is a harsh place for a solitary girl, even one as tough as Margo. What should be a two-day trip becomes a two-year odyssey, with Margo encountering both enemies and friends in her quest for a home where she can live life on her own terms. With a powerful narrative voice, Margo is a modern-day Huck Finn who knows her own mind and, despite the best efforts of society, refuses to be civilized.

Orphaned and impoverished by the death of their father, Lucrezia Buti and her sister have no choice but to devote their lives to Christ. As fate would have it, the new novitiates enter the convent just as the chaplain, Fra Filippo, is endeavoring to complete a commission for the great Cosimo de' Medici. In Lucrezia's beautiful face, Filippo finally finds the inspiration for his greatest Madonna--and the stirrings of a love that will scandalize Prato. Fans of historical fiction will relish this tale of passion, love, violence, and betrayal, all set against a backdrop of astounding artistry.

525	UE5722	Anatomy of a Disappearance		22	0	After the death of his mother when he's a young boy, Nuri lives a quiet life with his father in Cairo, in exile from his homeland (an unnamed Middle Eastern country). When the unhappy pair meets beautiful and vivacious Mona on vacation, the young woman captivates both father and son. She eventually marries Nuri's father, causing much heartache and confusion for the adolescent boy, who sometimes wishes for his father's demise. Nuri comes to vehemently regret his ill will, however, when his father goes missing. As he searches for answers, Nuri begins to piece together his father's life as a political dissident, uncovering shocking secrets that lead to more questions about the mysterious man and about Nuri's own identity. Award-winning author Hisham Matar--whose own father was abducted as a Libyan political prisoner--has written a poignant and beautifully sparse novel that reflects upon grief, loss, and the complicated relationship between father and son.

The editors of this handsome Everyman's Library Pocket Poets edition contend that the murder poem, <i>"taking as its subject the very worst aspects of human nature--our propensity for crime, cruelty, and bloodshed--&hellip;shapes that disruptive material into order, wholeness, and meaning."</i> Riveting, spine-tingling, and often profound, these works by such poets as Robert Browning, W.

533	UE5522	The President Is a Sick Man		19.96	24.95	Over the Fourth of July holiday in 1893, President Grover Cleveland boarded a luxury yacht to undergo surgery to remove a tumor from his jaw. The operation was kept strictly confidential, as it was perilous to the life of the president and the politics of the country. At the time, the United States was mired in its worst financial crisis yet, and a bitter economic battle raged over the future of monetary policy. Cleveland knew that news of his illness would cause a further panic to the economy, so keeping the operation secret was supremely important. What followed was one of the greatest political cover-ups of the age. Matthew Algeo weaves a fascinating narrative, explaining the complex back-story sufficiently while still keeping the brisk pace of a dramatic tale. This book of little-known history is a compelling page-turner!

M. F. K. Fisher	Hardcover, 108 pages; 2011	0	Mayonnaise, real mayonnaise, good mayonnaise, is something I can dream of any time, almost, and not because I ate it when I was little but because I did not. My maternal grandmother, whose Victorian neuroses dictated our family table-tastes until I was about twelve, found salads generally suspect, but would tolerate the occasional serving of some watery lettuce in a dish beside each plate... On it would be a dab or lump or blob, depending on the current cook, of what was quietly referred to as Boiled Dressing. It seemed dreadful stuff--enough to harm one's soul.

But the mouse-run Prisoners' Aid Society thinks she is the only rodent for the job. So the motley crew of Miss Bianca, a rough-and-tumble Norwegian seafarer called Nils, and a devoted companion named Bradley make the difficult journey to the dreadful Black Castle, where the dangers they encounter--not the least of which is a ferocious feline--have the trio risking life and limb for their noble mission. Whether or not they are familiar with the 1977 Disney film adaptation, young readers (and nostalgic adults!) will adore Margery Sharp's adventurous and cleverly funny classic.

All that changed when Paul suffered a massive stroke. Suddenly the great wordsmith's voice was stripped of all but a single syllable: "mem." Traditional speech therapy produced exasperatingly slow results, and Diane despaired of ever recovering the man Paul had once been. But as weeks turned into months, she realized that by combining her scientific knowledge of language and her deep familiarity with Paul's personality, she could help him channel his creativity and retrieve enough language to write again. (In perhaps their most touching "therapy" exercise, Diane demanded Paul create new pet names for her, to replace the ones erased by the stroke. His chaotic word associations produced such tender gems as Blessed Little Smile, Jocund Sprite of the Dew, and Lovely Ampersand of the Morning.)

She buys an herb shop and expects a nice quiet life, far removed from the <i>"bad guys"</i> she was highly paid to protect in her legal career. But, as usually happens with lovable mystery-series heroines, crime and other dark happenings tend to pop up around her. Each of the <b>China Bayles Mysteries</b> (which currently number eighteen) features a particular herb in the title, and information on growing and using herbs is woven into each witty and compelling plot. Our favorite thing about this series is the character development. Susan Wittig Albert--who was among the ghostwriters of Carolyn Keene's Nancy Drew series--creates every (often quirky) individual with delightfully engaging detail.

Leather-bound and embossed, in raggedy paperback, pink poofy cover, audio, multimedia, or clutched in the perfectly manicured fingers of Paris Hilton en route to jail. People swear on it in courtrooms. Families record births, marriages, divorces, and deaths in its pages. Soldiers take it into battle, and peaceniks wave it in demonstrations of opposition.

635	UE4772	A Brief Guide to the Modern Library		13.95	0	We often think of the great English-language novels as being penned by the literary giants of old. But there's been plenty of excellent, groundbreaking fiction written in modern times. In this entertaining guide to contemporary literature, award-winning author Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and publisher/author Carmen Callil present a selection of 200 novels written since 1950. From Agatha Christie's <i>A Murder Is Announced</i> (1950) to V. S. Pritchett's <i>The Lady from Guatemala</i>(1998), the authors make impassioned arguments for the literary merit of the titles, which were chosen for their <i>"illustration of the very life of the author, the power of the live voice, the passion to tell a story, invent characters and find a form."</i> Serious readers will find it gratifying to come across books they've read and loved, and everyone is bound to find a plethora of modern classics to add their to-read list!

636	UE5332	Tolstoy and the Purple Chair: My Year of Magical Reading		23.99	0	When Nina Sankovitch's oldest sister died of cancer, the grief was devastating. Exhausted and overwhelmed, the former attorney made a drastic decision: She would strip her daily routine down to the bare essentials to allow herself the time to read a book a day, every day, for one year. Such a radical shift in priorities was no easy task; after all, being a stay-at-home mother to four sons amounted to a full-time job. Yet her escape into books--novels, memoirs, and short stories, classic as well as contemporary volumes--offered her a much-needed opportunity to reinvigorate her passion for life, her interest in the world, and her devotion to her family. And by the end of the year, she was able to finally <i>"come up whole again." </i>Should you be inspired to tackle your own book-a-day (or perhaps book-a-week) "year of magical reading," this introspective journal culminates in an alphabetical list of the books Sankovitch read. It is an impressive to-do list, bluestocking-style!

640	UE4052	Correspondence: An Adventure in Letters		24.95	0	The excerpt above comes from an e-mail written by Larry Dickerson--a retired personal banker from New Jersey--to Stephen Nicholls, an associate in the books and manuscripts department at Christie's in London. Dickerson, you see, has inherited a collection of correspondence between his great-great-grandfather (who was a bookseller in Victorian London) and several of the most interesting novelists of that time, including Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy, and Anthony Trollope. Though a little rough around the edges, the American is very bright and soon becomes somewhat obsessed with nineteenth-century British literature. Throughout the course of this novel-in-letters, Dickerson and the scholarly Nicholls build an irresistibly charming friendship. Several of the letters between Dickerson's great-great-grandfather and the famous writers are included in <b>Correspondence</b>, too--and thanks to author N.

642	UE4702	Louisa May Alcott: A Personal Biography		26	0	Susan Cheever adds "personal" to the subtitle of her biography of Louisa May Alcott because, as a young girl, she found refuge in the pages of <i>Little Women</i>, Alcott's classic story of four sisters growing up in a warm, loving family in New England during the Civil War. In a sense, Alcott herself may have escaped into the home and family she created in her book, as the facts of her childhood were, sadly, dramatically different from the life lived by the March girls of <i>Little Women</i>. Alcott's father was difficult: an eccentric philosopher and educator who constantly pursued new venues for his theories and practices. He moved his family from one town to another, from one house to the other--more than twenty times in Alcott's childhood and youth. While the March girls of the novel lived in genteel poverty, the Alcotts were often on the verge of starvation. Clearly, Alcott rewrote her own life in her <i>Little Women</i>.

Fearing the worst, she enlists the help of her father, the surly but likeable pathologist Quirke, newly sober after a stint in rehab. As Quirke and Phoebe delve deeper into April's troubled past--and carefully navigate their own fraught relationship--they are continually thwarted by the ruthlessly powerful Latimer family. But Quirke suspects the Latimers, who disowned the rebellious April years earlier, know more than they are letting on, and it seems ugly secrets lurk around every corner. The fourth novel by Benjamin Black (mystery-writer pseudonym of Booker Prize-winner John Banville), <b>Elegy for April</b> is a darkly lyrical spine-tingler.

Despite his bluster, she believes she is his favorite--until she refuses to marry Phinnie Paine, the man being primed to take over the family business. Infuriated by Jane's disobedience, her father banishes her to Boston to nurse a sickly relative, hoping the exile will bring the rebellious girl to heel. But pre-revolutionary Boston, where colonial patriots clash daily with British loyalists and occupying redcoats, is an exciting new world for a sheltered young woman. Away from her father's influence, Jane is finally free to explore her own opinions and beliefs. Yet when British-colonial tensions explode on a cold night in 1770, she is caught in the middle, forced to choose once and for all between doing what is expected of her and doing what is right.

655	UE4572	A Jane Austen Education: How Six Novels Taught Me About Love, Friendship, and the Things That Really Matter		25.95	0	From here on out, whenever I meet a man who scoffs at Jane Austen, I will refer him to this delightful memoir. As a doctoral candidate at Columbia University, William Deresiewicz was a devotee of modernist literature who abhorred the romantic sentiment of nineteenth-century British novels. But when his professor assigned Austen's <i>Emma</i>, Deresiewicz's true education began. From the value of the ordinary and the importance of humility to the dangers of perpetual amusement and the power of friendship, the young man discovered astute object lessons woven into Austen's half-dozen novels of love, family, and social convention. As time passed and he applied her keen insight to his own life, he found himself finally evolving into the man he had always hoped to be. What a heartening tale, especially for the Austen detractor in your life!		William Deresiewicz	Hardcover, 272 pages; 2011	22.06	I was twenty-six, and about as dumb, in all human things, as any twenty-six-year-old has a right to be, when I met the woman who would change my life. That she'd been dead for a couple of hundred years made not the slightest difference whatsoever. Her name was Jane Austen, and she would teach me everything I know about everything that matters.

657	UE5372	Twenty-Five Books that Shaped America		14.99	0	This intriguing book offers one perceptive and funny man's view of the twenty-five most influential works in American fiction. Is it definitive? That's for you and your literary sparring partners to hash out. Foster weaves summary and analysis together for each selection. Most interestingly, he traces the development of American literature from the early years imitating Europeans to the full emergence of American style. Some predictable favorites such as <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> and <i>The Great Gatsby</i> make the list, but Foster's snappy prose keeps them fresh. There are plenty of fun surprises as well (<i>The Cat in the Hat?</i>). Not all of these books are Foster's personal favorites, and some he flat-out doesn't like (<i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, for example), but he offers compelling arguments for each one's profound impact on American character.

663	UE5142	The Selected Works of T. S. Spivet		16	0	Twelve-year-old Tecumseh Sparrow Spivet (T. S. for short) is a precociously gifted cartographer and all-around unique kid. Raised on a remote Montana ranch by his cowboy father and scientist mother, T. S. can map anything: not just places, but people, events, and emotions, too. It is a handy skill for coping with life's ups and downs, but it isn't so great for making friends. So when T. S. learns he has won a prestigious award from the Smithsonian, he jumps at the chance to go where his unusual gift will be appreciated. There's just one catch: The Smithsonian thinks T. S. is an adult. Determined to prove himself worthy, he hops a freight train headed east, embarking upon an extraordinary journey across America. Rich in humor and whimsy, much of T. S.'s story unfolds in the notes, maps, and other illustrations "sketched" into the margins, enriching one of the most ingenious novels I have read in a long while.

And as the days and meals unfold, so do the compelling stories the students bring to the table. Among them is Claire, a harried wife and mother anxious to reclaim her sense of self; Helen and Carl, the long-married couple whose public devotion to each other cloaks a secret; Antonia, an immigrant seeking a sense of place; Tom, whose tragic love has left him brokenhearted; Chloe, the rebellious teen who seems to ruin everything she touches; kind Ian, a young man desperate to fall in love; and Isabelle, who is chasing new experiences even as her disintegrating memory strips them away.

666	UE4692	Lives Like Loaded Guns: Emily Dickinson and Her Family's Feuds		18	0	In 1882, Emily Dickinson's brother Austin betrayed his wife of twenty-six years (who was an intimate friend of the poet) to pursue Mabel Todd, a young Amherst faculty wife who would become enthralled with Austin's reclusive sister and her visionary work. This scandalous affair sparked a dramatic schism within the Dickinson family. Eventually, the feud resulted in different sides laying claim to the poet's unpublished papers after her death, and a battle to control the poet's legacy raged for generations. Drawing upon letters, diaries, autobiographies, and legal documents, award-winning biographer Lyndall Gordon deconstructs the long-held perception of Dickinson as a cold and demure spinster, instead revealing a passionate creative genius pulled apart by family drama and suffering from a secret illness, which Gordon (somewhat controversially) posits is epilepsy. <b>Lives Like Loaded Guns</b> is a groundbreaking literary biography that's as enthralling as it is revealing.

A sort of personal cultural history of the past sixty years, <b>On Admiration </b>is a thought-provoking and uplifting treatise on the value of admiring and emulating worthy people.		W.D.

700	UE2722	Our Tempestuous Day		14.99	0	<b>Our Tempestuous Day</b> takes a lively plunge into all the social, political, religious, economic, and moral complexities of England in the years between 1810 and 1820. With plenty of big personalities and turbulent drama, this enthralling history often reads like juicy fiction. Carolly Erickson's insightful book is sure to please Anglophiles, historians, and anyone interested in paradoxical times.		Carolly Erickson	Paperback, 304 pages; 2011 (1986)	12.74	&hellip;beneath the surface glitter of Regency life--the opulent interiors, the elegant dress, the grand, scenic architecture--was an underlying malaise, a pervasive emptiness and sense of loss that afflicted a wide spectrum of the populace. Equally powerful was a shift in the moral tone, an urge to uplift, improve and spiritually regenerate the realm--and the world, if possible.

701	UD7712	Hide My Eyes		14.95	0	For many mystery readers, the series is king, and with good reason: As with a really swell TV series, there is a lot of pleasure to be found in watching characters change and grow, watching friendships and romances build from their first, tentative beginnings. But for me, there's an almost greater pleasure in following the development of a writer as his or her skills and sensibilities deepen and mature over time. And with no one is this truer than of Margery Allingham. In rereading the astonishing <b>Hide My Eyes</b>, I was particularly struck by one line: Someone has remarked on Mr. Campion's rather theatrical diffidence, and the response comes back, <i>"It's an affectation of his time. Young men invented it in the twenties."</i> Albert Campion may still conceal his splendid mind behind a flurry of flyweight witticisms, but Margery Allingham, nearing the end of her life and her career, was no longer so constrained. <b>Hide My Eyes </b>is a serious, even a beautiful book.

702	UE2022	The Anatomy of Ghosts		24.99	0	In 1786, after the untimely deaths of his wife and son, impoverished London bookseller John Holdsworth has little hope for the future. But then he receives a summons from Lady Anne Oldershaw, a wealthy widow with a perplexing and delicate problem. It seems her son Frank, a student at Jerusalem College in Cambridge, had a breakdown after spying a ghost on the college grounds. Lady Anne enlists Holdsworth's help because, as author of the treatise <i>An Anatomy of Ghosts,</i> he is purported to be an expert at debunking ghost sightings. Holdsworth fears he has little chance of "curing" young Frank, but Lady Anne pays very well, and so off to Cambridge he goes. What he finds is an academic world steeped in tradition, privilege, and professional rivalry, all ruled by the members of the Holy Ghost Club, an elite secret society. With the help of Elinor Carbury, the clever wife of Jerusalem's top administrator, Holdsworth sets about unraveling the true nature of young Frank's predicament--and the ugly secrets it conc		Andrew Taylor	Hardcover, 412 pages; 2011	21.24		(KG)			0	YES	UB3992	1							0			1AB;1AC;2AJ	FICTION > STRICTLY FICTION									THE ANATOMY OF GHOSTS	UE2022	UE2022	UE2022			0				1										NSUM11	38	0000-00-00	1						0	2011-06-07				0000-00-00 00:00:00

High-school sweethearts in Kentucky, they were separated by war and reunited years later in California. They married, bought a home, and had a child. And yet Pearlie can never quite "see to the bottom" of Holland. Then in 1953, when Buzz Drumer shows up unexpectedly on her doorstep, Pearlie finally understands why. It seems Buzz met Holland during the war, and their friendship gradually evolved into romance. Now Buzz has come to reclaim his man--Pearlie's man--and he wants her help to make it happen. It is a shocking proposition&hellip;and a tempting one. For as this bewitching story unfolds, so does Pearlie, and before long the simple girl from Kentucky reveals herself to be the most unpredictable of them all.

756	UD7212	Uncommon Arrangements: Seven Marriages		7	14	In the first half of the twentieth century, many British writers, artists, and intellectuals took some intriguingly creative approaches to marriage. In <b>Uncommon Arrangements</b>, penetrating cultural critic Katie Roiphe illuminates all the complicated ideals, challenges, and emotions present in the relationships between seven fascinating couples--among them H. G. and Jane Wells, Katherine Mansfield and John Middleton Murry, and Vanessa and Clive Bell--engaged in <i>"marriages &agrave; la mode."</i> Both rousingly intimate and seriously insightful, this social history of marriage will keep you rapt in wonder, amusement, and introspection.		Katie Roiphe	Paperback, 343 pages; 2008 (2007)	0	As a union falters or fails, these writers and artists create vivid alternatives for themselves: they imagine another form of family, including friends and lovers and siblings and ex-fames, and take from the outside world what emotional sustenance they need. Where the usual, nuclear family will not hold, they invent a structure--singular, new, innovative, often mad--that sometimes, in rare and magnificent moments, works.

757	UD6882	Nightingale Wood		16	0	Lovely Viola Withers, a young, penniless widow, feels she must accept her in-laws' (less than heartfelt) invitation to move into their stuffy home in Essex, England. The joylessness and daily tedium at the Withers household--where an overbearing, contrary patriarch keeps a tight rein on his haughty wife and their two spinster daughters--threatens to stifle Viola's vivaciousness, until she has a run-in with Victor Spring, a handsome and wealthy local bachelor whose impending engagement does not deter him from flirting with Viola. With comically flawed characters, all sorts of romantic entanglements, and even a charity ball as a pivotal plot point, Nightingale Wood is a somewhat satirical Cinderella tale that takes aim at class snobbery, social conventions, and traditional gender roles. First published in 1938, this later novel from the beloved author of Cold Comfort Farm is a charming and wholly satisfying read.

780	UD4182	The Cottage Tales of Beatrix Potter		22.97	0	Based on the real life of beloved author/illustrator Beatrix Potter, this perfectly enchanting mystery series begins in 1905 with Potter--a Londoner of high social standing, in her late thirties, unwed (and grieving the death of her fianc&eacute;)--buying a farm in the rural English countryside. Potter thinks she's moved to a quiet little village where she can work peacefully on her children's books, but she soon finds herself puzzling through suspicious cases of foul play and other curious happenings. Her diverse and charismatic troop of animal friends is, though Potter and the other humans in the village don't realize it, enthusiastically involved in helping straighten out the mysterious matters. In <b>The Cottage Tales of Beatrix Potter,</b> Susan Wittig Albert--best-selling author of <b>The China Bayles Mysteries </b>(see page 76) and a former ghostwriter of Carolyn Keene's Nancy Drew series--has created a marvelously charming and utterly unique collection of historical "detective" novels.

799	UD8252	The Englishman Who Posted Himself and Other Curious Objects		24.95	0	A most unconventional biography, <b>The Englishman Who Posted Himself&hellip;</b> tells the story of W. Reginald Bray (1879-1939), an accountant and family man with a peculiar hobby: challenging the ingenuity of the British postal service. After studying the rules and regulations of the postal authorities, Bray mailed tens of thousands of postal curios: strangely addressed missives (written in coded verse, for example, or sent to "all the post offices in the world"); a wide variety of odd, unwrapped objects (a turnip, a bicycle pump, a bowler hat, dog biscuits, and a rabbit's skull); even living things, including his Irish terrier and himself (separately)! Eventually, Bray channeled his meticulous nature into amassing the world's largest autograph collection (via the postal system, of course). With a wealth of reproductions of Bray's most inventive postal-art creations, John Tingey's rollicking portrait of the Edwardian postal prankster will delight anyone who's ever been consumed by a hobby.

841	UD8492	Mr. Rosenblum Dreams in English		23.99	0	Jack and Sadie Rosenblum arrive in London in 1937, Berlin-born Jews fleeing Nazi Germany. Convinced that their survival depends upon successful assimilation, Jack devotes himself to becoming a "genuine Englishman." He stops speaking German, has his suits made on Savile Row, and never, ever criticizes the British government. Yet despite his most diligent efforts, he cannot achieve the one thing that will make him truly English: membership in a golf club. No club in England will admit a German, let alone a Jewish one. And so Jack decides to build his own course--despite never having swung a golf club. Ever the optimist, he moves his reluctant wife to a ramshackle cottage in Dorset and, with little more than his own two hands, sets about transforming the rolling countryside into a course worthy of the best players. But when a series of setbacks threatens to derail Jack's plan, it's up to Sadie and some surprising new friends to salvage his quixotic dream in this poignant, gently comic novel about the power of ho		Natasha Solomons	Hardcover, 357 pages; 2010	20.39		(KG)			0	YES	UB3992	1							0			1AC;1AB	FICTION > STRICTLY FICTION									MR.

He's pretty proud of his special cargo, even when the villagers, shepherds, and others he meets along the way learn of his destination and add their gifts to his load. His journey becomes increasingly difficult, until one last straw, the only offering of a poor child, finally overwhelms him. But when he sees the baby king in his cradle, Hoshmakaka's burden is lifted, and he recognizes the importance of his journey. A wonderfully fresh perspective on the Christmas story, <b>The Last Straw</b> is bound to become a holiday favorite. For ages 4 to 8. And with his soft fur and knobby knees, our splay-legged <b>Hoshmakaka Toy</b> (about 9" high) is an awfully cute companion to Fredrick Thury's inspiring story!

847	UD7072	The Six-Cornered Snowflake: A New Year's Gift		12	0	Best known for the "laws of planetary motion" that bear his name, brilliant seventeenth-century astronomer and mathematician Johannes Kepler was also a philosophical soul. In 1610 (or thereabouts), Kepler composed a wonder-filled treatise to accompany the unusual New Year's gift he selected for his friend and benefactor, Lord Matth&auml;us Wacker von Wackenfels. The perfect present, Kepler decided, as he walked to Von Wackenfels's home for a visit, was the little <i>"nothing"</i> of a snowflake. In <b>The Six-Cornered Snowflake</b>, the reader is treated to an enlightening glimpse into Kepler's scientific--and witty--mind as he contemplates why crystals always possess a sixfold symmetry. This newly published paperback edition also includes snowflake illustrations, a snowflake-shaped poem, and thoughtful introductions to Kepler and his enthusiastically intellectual essay.

852	UD7152	The Tower, the Zoo, and the Tortoise		24.95	0	Balthazar Jones--protagonist of this charming novel--has a most interesting address: He lives in the Tower of London. A Beefeater assigned to guard the former royal palace and prison, Balthazar spends his days leading tours, directing visitors to the lavatory, and chasing down pickpockets. But when the Queen decides to relocate her royal menagerie from the London Zoo to the Tower, Balthazar, by way of owning the world's oldest living tortoise, is tapped as the animals' caretaker. His wife, Hebe, is none too thrilled at the prospect of bringing yet more peculiar creatures into their little "neighborhood." Among the characters already residing within the Tower walls are the Tower chaplain, who secretly writes salacious novels and pines for a local barmaid; the Yeoman Gaoler, a man plagued nightly by the ghosts of former prisoners; and Mrs. Cook, the Joneses' 181-year-old tortoise. Witty, tender, and quirky, <b>The Tower, the Zoo, and the Tortoise</b> is a literary delight!

870	UD7172	Twain's Feast: Searching for America's Lost Foods in the Footsteps of Samuel Clemens		12.98	25.95	Mark Twain's appetite for adventure was matched only by his appetite for food--truly American food that he bitterly missed while traipsing through Europe. The celebrated author's <i>A Tramp Abroad</i> famously lists the foods that fueled Twain's homesickness throughout his European tour. Intrigued and inspired by that food list, Andrew Beahrs created <b>Twain's Feast</b>. Part memoir, part culinary history, and part ecological treatise, this deliciously enticing book explores Twain's America through the food that he loved, and compares nineteenth-century dietary trends to what and how we eat today. Amusing and lighthearted but seriously fascinating, <b>Twain's Feast</b> will have you contemplating prairie hens and raccoons as dinner fare!

But he dutifully proposes to the right girl and seems primed to finally bring the Mackinnons into society's innermost circles--until Chip meets Jean Cooper, a beguiling Midwestern beauty with no social connections. Chip and Jean's passionate and defiant affair pit father against son in a testosterone-fueled battle of wills that lays bare the complex relationship between parent and adult child, with the love between the two men threatening to turn irrevocably into violent hatred.

Six-year-old Joe is in need of some good fortune. Not only do he and his mother need money to join his father in Africa, but their down-on-their-luck neighbors could use some financial help as well. So it seems miraculous when Joe finds a small unicorn--which many mistake for a crippled baby goat--at the animal market! Since everyone knows that unicorns grant wishes, Joe hopes that the sickly animal is strong enough to help Mr. Kandinsky procure a new steam press for his trouser-making shop, to make Shmule win his wrestling match so he can afford a diamond ring for his girl, and, of course, to reunite Joe's family. A sweet story about hope, kindness, and the innocent wisdom of children, </b>A Kid for Two Farthings</b> is a charming read for adults nostalgic for simpler times.

Young Zhanna Arshanskaya, a fourteen-year-old piano prodigy, was among those on the trek. Her father found an opportunity to bribe a guard and sent her off into the woods with the parting words, "I don't care what you do. Just live." <b>Hiding in the Spotlight</b> tells the incredible true story of Zhanna's survival, under the assumed identity of a gentile Russian orphan. The cruel irony of her life occurred when a piano tuner heard her play and sent her off to join a troupe of musicians who entertained Nazi officers. Throughout the war years, she never heard or spoke her real name, and she survived by playing the music she loved for the enjoyment of those who would have had her killed if they had discovered her true identity.

918	UD2572	The Bront&euml;s Went to Woolworth's		14	0	Journalist Deirdre Carne and her two young sisters enjoy an extremely rich fantasy life in 1930s London. Many people don't understand the girls' created "realities," including a charming and very intricate imagined friendship with a real high-court judge in their neighborhood. When Deirdre actually befriends the judge's wife--in real life--the sisters find themselves having to reconcile fact and fiction. The Bront&eumlat; sisters do play an unpredictable role in the book, but devotees be warned--the Carnes are not fans of the Bront&eumlat;s' work (at one point, for example, one of the Carne sisters reports that Emily, though long deceased, is working on a new book called <i>Swithering Depths</i>!). Full of endearing characters and enchanting surprises, this novel from 1931 is quite the literary escapade!		Rachel Ferguson	Paperback, 188 pages; 2010 (1931)	11.9	Three years ago I was proposed to. I couldn't accept the man, much as I liked him, because I was in love with Sherlock Holmes. For Holmes and his personality and brain I had a force of feeling which, for the time, converted living men to shadows. After all, isn't most love the worship of an idea or an illusion? Isn't flesh and blood the least part of the business?

927	UD1012	Epilogue: A Memoir		14.99	0	Novelist Anne Roiphe's bare-bones memoir offers a strikingly honest portrait of the year and a half following the death of her husband of thirty-nine years. In clear, unsentimental, and beautifully written vignettes, Roiphe chronicles her painful acclimation to the everyday challenges of widowhood. Though aching loneliness is palpable in her brutally self-aware descriptions of getting accustomed to hailing her own cab or attending movies alone, a faint but tenable thread of hope runs throughout the book. When her daughters place a personal ad for her in the <i>New York Review of Books</i> Roiphe's late-in-life reentrance into the dating world provides, for both author and reader, welcome levity and distraction. Ultimately, <b>Epilogue</b> is the inspiring story of one erudite woman's learning to cope with a difficult--but, of course, all too common--transition.

All they have in common are grief and loneliness, and yet the surprising passion that sparks between them brings both to life in a way they never dreamed possible. But while opposites do attract, the couple finds it's not so easy to stay together when bombarded by the everyday details of their divergent lives. Set in present-day Sweden and told from the lovers' alternating points of view, <b>Benny and Shrimp</b> is a charming account of how messy, inconvenient, and yet utterly absorbing true love can be.

952	UC5852	Fathers and Sons: The Autobiography of a Family		14.95	0	In 2001, Alexander Waugh, grandson of acclaimed novelist Evelyn Waugh, was grieving the death of his father, journalist Auberon Waugh, when he was presented with the above proposal. Before long, what began as a short article evolved into an insider's biography of one of Britain's most prolific literary families. Alexander doesn't ignore the influence of the Waugh women on the family legacy, but it's the complex, often contentious relationships between fathers and sons that absorb his attention here. Alexander's great-great-grandfather Alexander "The Brute" Waugh's efforts to toughen up his son Arthur bordered on the sadistic. Arthur, in turn, doted on his son Alec to the point of obsession, holding him up as the ideal to which younger son Evelyn could never reach, even after his own success eclipsed his brother's. Sympathetic without pulling punches, <b>Fathers and Sons</b> paints an intriguing portrait of an exceptional literary dynasty.		Alexander Waugh	Paperback, 472 pages; 2007 (2004)	12.71	Then the telephone rang. A frosty voice from the newspaper that was planning to run extracts of God said: "Actually, we've been having a think about this, and what we really want is an article by you on your family, you know, something about your father and your grandfather but mixing it in with a bit of stuff from your book, yeah?" Red rag to a bull. It had been the same when I published my previous book&hellip;but God as well? "Surely God is of greater interest to your readers than Auberon or Evelyn Waugh?" I demanded. A long, chilly silence emanated from the other end of the line. So I was wrong.

The novel centers around Kate Heron, a wealthy, middle-aged widow, whose scandalous remarriage to a man ten years her junior--the charming but directionless Dermot--is the subject of much speculation by her friends and family. As Kate tends to the daily tedium of her domestic duties at their Thames Valley estate, the members of her family--a nosy spinster aunt, a sanctimonious daughter, and a playboy son--remain both remarkably self-absorbed and relentlessly judgmental of the matriarch. The return to the village of Kate's old friend Charles--now a widower--and his pretty young daughter offers Kate a reassuring link to her past. But, as the two families grow closer, increasing undercurrents of lust and jealousy culminate in a tragic ending to the summer.

981	UC0272	Dictation: A Quartet		24	0	Cynthia Ozick's latest book consists of four intelligent stories that lead the reader playfully through winding paths of plot. The title story presents a fictional scheme by the secretaries of Henry James and Joseph Conrad to make their own mark on literature by surreptitiously inserting bits from each writer's current work into that of the other's before manuscripts are sent to their respective publishers. In "Actors,"an aging and often unemployed character actor is offered a Lear-like role, and then is stalked by the deceased playwright's father, on whom the role is based. "At Fumicaro"takes an American literary critic to Mussolini's Italy for a conference. He falls in love with a teenaged chambermaid, whom he first meets as she is vomiting in his room's toilet. In the final story, "What Happened to the Baby,"a young college student keeps tab on her eccentric, intellectual uncle at her mother's request, and inadvertently unravels a family myth.

Matt, an artist, is sitting nearby, feeding the ducks as he sketches them. They speak, fall in love, marry, and, with their little daughter, Molly, live an idyllic life in a country cottage. But then Matt must go off to war, and loses his life in the battle of Crete. This is one of those lovely novels in which every strand that's spun at the beginning is woven back in at the end. Lorna's difficult relationship with her mother, the cottage where the three lived so happily, Matt's wildlife engravings, and the island of Crete all figure dramatically in the life of Molly's daughter Ruth, the granddaughter whom Matt and Lorna never knew.

Raised in Europe by an indulgent widower father, Sophy Stanton-Lacy is as mischievous and willful as she is intelligent and capable, characteristics not at all en vogue with the well-bred young ladies of Regency England. Sophy quickly turns the Ombersley family on its ear, scandalizing her aunt, infuriating her handsome cousin Charles, and utterly enthralling London's bachelors with her outrageous--if well-intentioned--meddling into the lives of family and friends. As literary heroines go, the effervescent Sophy is thoroughly memorable and utterly lovable, so adept at getting into scrapes that she will keep readers laughing until the very last page.

1045	HL9322	Jacqueline Kennedy: Historic Conversations On Life With John F. Kennedy Book and CDs		34.99	60	No American family has captured our hearts and minds more than the Kennedys. Beginning in 1964, soon after her husband's assassination, Jacqueline Kennedy began an unprecedented oral history project. With the historian Arthur Schlesinger, she recorded a series of conversations about her experiences and impressions as JFK's wife and confidante. The tapes were then sealed and were to be stored in the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library. Available at last, introduced by Caroline Kennedy, they provide an astonishingly detailed and unvarnished account of the Kennedy White House.
