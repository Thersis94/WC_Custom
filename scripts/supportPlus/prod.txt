Each of the Drew shoes feature <b>Added or Double Added Depth</b> and come with two removable insoles, giving you the option to remove one or both to accommodate your prescribed orthotics.

1453	FB3722	Wigwam&reg; Diabetic Thermal Sock		8.95	12	<b>BENEFITS OF WIGWAM&reg; SOCKS</b><br> 1. Super Stretch for No Constriction - All of our medical styles have a loose-knit leg that stays up with minimal compression, to enhance circulation and comfort. They are easier to put on and take off and will not bunch up, which can cause an irritating condition.<br>2. Wicking Power for Dry Feet - "Wicking" is the key word for these socks. It means that they are constructed to pull moisture away from your skin, to evaporate into the air. Keeping your feet dry prevents fungus and infections. Your feet are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer. That's the right environment for healthy feet! <br>3. Smooth or Flat Toe Seam for Minimum Irritation - Non-chafing closure is mandatory for therapeutic socks - particularly for people with diabetes who may not be able to feel pain and chafing, which could cause dangerous infections.<br><br> <b>Blanket your Feet with Comfort & Protection</b><ul><li>Relaxed fit thermal made to keep your feet and dry</li><li>Extra wide, super stretch top for added comfort and donning ease</li><li>Smooth toe seam and cushioned sole</li><li>Machine washable</li></ul><i>Specify Color: Grey/Denim, Grey/Black, or Loden/Olive 65% Acrylic, 20% Merino Wool, 10% Stretch Nylon, 4% Stretch Polyester, 1% Elastic (rubber).	<br><p><b>Free Shipping Today when you Join Support Plus Savers Club. <a href="http://www.supportplus.com/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi?action=detail&item=SPSAVE"><font color="#0000CC">Click here to learn how!</a></font></b></p>	FB3722_1;FB3722_2	0	YES		1							0			1BK;1FB;1FE;1FF;1FG;1FH;1FI;1FJ;1FK;1IB;1IC;3A1;3FA;3IA	THERAPEUTIC SOCKS > SOCKS		FC0072;FC2692;FC2682			FA7592G				WIGWAM DIABETIC THERMAL SOCK;WARM SOCKS;WIGWAM SOCKS;THERMAL SOCKS;DIABETIC SOCKS;FB3722	FB3722		FB3722	FB3722					1										SPRING311	44	0000-00-00	1						0	2008-08-29	9			2012-04-18 14:27:36

1860	FA7692	Wigwam&reg; Therapeutic Sock		12.95	0	<b>BENEFITS OF WIGWAM&reg; SOCKS</b><br> 1. Super Stretch for No Constriction - All of our medical styles have a loose-knit leg that stays up with minimal compression, to enhance circulation and comfort. They are easier to put on and take off and will not bunch up, which can cause an irritating condition.<br>2. Wicking Power for Dry Feet - "Wicking" is the key word for these socks. It means that they are constructed to pull moisture away from your skin, to evaporate into the air. Keeping your feet dry prevents fungus and infections. Your feet are warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer. That's the right environment for healthy feet! <br>3. Smooth or Flat Toe Seam for Minimum Irritation - Non-chafing closure is mandatory for therapeutic socks - particularly for people with diabetes who may not be able to feel pain and chafing, which could cause dangerous infections. <br>4. Cushioning for Impact Absorption - Called for in many therapeutic socks, but not all of them. In some cases this could make your shoes uncomfortably tight. <br><br> <b>Very Stretchy & Soft&hellip;Ideal for Swollen Ankles and Edema </b><ul><li>Advanced moisture absorbing acrylic fiber absorbs moisture, carries it away from your foot and disperses it into the air to keep your feet dry and healthy.</li><li>Non-binding top, promotes good circulation and blister free wear.</li><li>Smooth toe closure and cushioned sole, reduces friction.</li><li>Stretches three times its flat dimension, easy to put on and off.</li><li>Machine washable.</li></ul> 45% Olefin, 30% X2O&#8482; Acrylic, 25% Stretch Nylon.	<br><p><b>Free Shipping Today when you Join Support Plus Savers Club. <a href="http://www.supportplus.com/cgi-bin/hazel.cgi?action=detail&item=SPSAVE"><font color="#0000CC">Click here to learn how!</a></font></b></p>	FA7692_1;FA7692_2	0	YES		1							0			1AQ;1BK;1FB;1FC;1FD;1FE;1FG;1FH;1FI;1FJ;1IB;1IC;2FA;2A1	THERAPEUTIC SOCKS > DIABETIC		FA7642;FB3722;FA7652			FA7592G				WIGWAM THERAPEUTIC SOCK;R340;FA7692	FA7692		FA7692	FA7692					1		1						<br>BUY 3/$10.95 per pair.

2148	FB9282G	Neuremedy&reg;, "The Neuropathy Vitamin"&#8482;	29.94-$54.94	0	0	<b>Relieve the pain and discomfort of Neuropathy<br>Proven safe and effective for thousands... Neuremedy&reg; an effective medical food. No prescription needed.</b><br><br> The special formulation in Neuremedy has been clinically shown to reduce the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy including pain, burning, numbness and tingling.<br><br><b>How It Works:</b><br> In order for the nerves in our body to function properly, we need to maintain adequate blood levels of thiamine (Vitamin B1). Recent studies have shown that many people suffering from peripheral neuropathy have low plasma levels of thiamine. These people need a more bioactive form of thiamine for their nerves to function properly. For these people, <b>Neuremedy reduces the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy by </b>delivering a highly bioactive form of the micro-nutrient thiamine to where it is needed, the nerve cells. Neuremedy works by nourishing the nerves.<br><b>What is Neuremedy?:</b><br>Neuremedy is a medical food that nourishes dysfunctional nerves allowing them to conduct impulses more normally. The specialized formulation in Neuremedy contains benfotiamine, Benfotiamine is a highly bioactive form of thiamine used to nutritionally manage the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. It has been used since the early 1960's to successfully help tens of thousands of patients suffering from peripheral neuropathy in Asia and Europe.<br><b>What is a Medical Food?: </b><br>A medical food is a nutrient that is taken under the supervision of a physician when a patient has special nutritional needs in order to manage a disease or health condition. In the case of Neuremedy, patients suffering from peripheral neuropathy may need the highly bioactive form of thiamine found in Neuremedy in order to nutritionally manage their neuropathy.<br><b>Safety Facts: </b>Neuremedy has been scientifically proven to be safe and effective.
